```


## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Groq Python Client](https://pypi.org/project/groq/)
- A valid Groq API key

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shathwik200/Python-Mentor-AI-Agent.git
   cd python-tutor-mentor
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install groq
   ```

4. Set your Groq API key:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
     ```
   - On Windows (Command Prompt):
     ```cmd
     set GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
     ```

5. Run the Python Tutor Mentor:
   ```bash
   python agent_python_tutor.py
   ```


## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the Python Tutor Mentor in a conversational manner. Here's an example interaction:

```plaintext
You: How do I define a function in Python?
Mentor: In Python, you define a function using the `def` keyword. For example:

    def greet(name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

This function takes a parameter `name` and returns a greeting. Let me know if you have any questions!
```

Feel free to ask questions about Python syntax, debugging, best practices, or anything else related to programming!
